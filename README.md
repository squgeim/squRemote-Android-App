# squRemote-Android-App
An Android app to control any media playback on a computer

See [squRemote-py](https://github.com/squgeim/squRemote-py) for the desktop companion.

### Requirements
Built and tested on Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus with Android Gingerbread. Known to work on Android Marshmallow.
Will probably still work on the lastest flagships (the scaling will be terrible, though).

### Note
This was a small one-time project and I can't promise any bug fixes or updates.
